# Arduino Projects Repository

Welcome to the Arduino Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects that I have created to learn and experiment with basic electronics and Arduino programming. These projects make use of various components from an Arduino starter kit, covering a range of applications from simple LED blinking to more complex sensor integrations and display communications.
